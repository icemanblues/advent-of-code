## 2018

This year is completed. All days were solved using Go. 
In some cases, they were also solved using python. This was a manner of comparing the two programming languages.

## 2017

This year is fully solved on the website. However, I had split some of the code between my desktop and laptop. 
Unfortunately, the laptop no longer works and I didn't get a chance to commit the code upstream.

Lesson learned. Commit early and often!

I started the year by using Java. 
Around Day 10, I realized that Java was slowing me down. Too much ceremony for a single file with a single function. 
I migrated my efforts to using Python in its place.

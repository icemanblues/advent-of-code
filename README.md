# Advent Of Code

Solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I use the advent of code as an opportunity to learn new programming languages, 
practice favorites that I don't get to use at work,
use new editors, and gain experience with new workflows.

## 2020

Complete: [x]  
Language: golang  
Editor: emacs  

I wanted to do this one in rustlang, however I didn't finish reading [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) in time.

## 2019

Complete: [x]  
Language: typescript  
Editor: emacs  

## 2018

Complete: [x]  
Language: golang  
Editor: vscode  

In some cases, challenges were also solved using python. This was a manner of comparing/ contrasting the two programming languages.

## 2017

Complete: [x]  
Language: python  
Editor: intellij  

This year is fully solved on the website. However, I had split some of the code between my desktop and laptop. 
Unfortunately, the laptop no longer works and I didn't get a chance to commit the code upstream.

Lesson learned: Commit early and often!

I started the year by using Java. 
Around Day 10, I realized that Java was slowing me down. Too much ceremony for a single file with a single function. 
I migrated my efforts to using Python in its place.
